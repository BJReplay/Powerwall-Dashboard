# InfluxDB 2.x Support

This includes optionals files and instructions to help setup InfluxDB 2.x (instead of 1.8) as the database for the Dashboard. Thanks to @ThePnuts for developing the many flux queries required to replace the 1.8 version continuous queries as well as the Grafana queries in the dashboard.json.

## Instructions

* Containers (setup)
  * I am using the official containers provided by influxdata and GrafanaLabs
    * [Influxdb 2.6](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/)

    * [Telegraf](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf/)
* InfluxDB 2.x setup
